# Portcullis

Portcullis is the Web application that powers **Vettio**. Built on Ruby on
Rails, every Web service to date we use is running behind this Web
application. This repository contains the source code used for building said
website.

## Getting Started
In order to build development with Portcullis, invoke the following:

  * Install [Vagrant][]. This allows for a identical, replicating, 
    production-level environment for each developer, designer or layman
    to work with. This is also kept up to date whenever new dependencies are
    made automatically.
